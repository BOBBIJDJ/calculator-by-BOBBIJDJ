## sum
 you can type sum \<first number\> \<second number\> \<third number\> \<fourth number\>

 the third and fourth numbers are optional you can make a sum even with only 2 or 3 numbers

 the program will display:

 the result is:

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> = \<sum\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> = \<sum\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> + \<fourth number\> = \<sum\>

 ## difference
 you can type difference \<first number\> \<second number\> \<third number\> \<fourth number\>

 the third and fourth numbers are optional you can make a difference even with only 2 or 3 numbers

 the program will display:

 the result is:

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> = \<difference\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> = \<difference\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> + \<fourth number\> = \<difference\>

  ## multiplication
 you can type multiplication \<first number\> \<second number\> \<third number\> \<fourth number\>

 the third and fourth numbers are optional you can make a multiplication even with only 2 or 3 numbers

 the program will display:

 the result is:

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> = \<multiplication\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> = \<multiplication\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> + \<fourth number\> = \<multiplication\>

  ## division
 you can type division \<first number\> \<second number\> \<third number\> \<fourth number\>

 the third and fourth numbers are optional you can make a division even with only 2 or 3 numbers

 the program will display:

 the result is:

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> = \<division\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> = \<division\>

 \<first number\> + \<second number\> + \<third number\> + \<fourth number\> = \<division\>

 ## end
 you can type end to close the program
